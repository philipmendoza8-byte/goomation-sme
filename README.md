## 🔥 Why This Exists

This isn’t just another template.  
This is **“ซอยของจริง”** — a sandbox for grassroots warriors, one chicken skewer at a time.

> "SMEs don't need perfect tools. They need the right tools, at the right time, delivered with grit."

## ⚙️ Stack Philosophy

- 🧩 **No-Code First** — Because SME time is blood.
- 🎯 **Real Prompts** — Trained by real vendors, not ivory towers.
- 🔄 **Local Loop** — Real-time feedback from real mouths.
- 🧠 **AI as Ally** — Not for show, but for survival.
